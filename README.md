### ACTIVE PROJECT
#
#
# Fintech Project 1
#
### This fintech project is/will be a full functioning web application and will eventually be deployed with heroku, or some other cloud platform service provider. First I created a stock screener that scrapes the stocks listed in the S+P 500. Next I gathered data about the stocks from the TD Ameritrade API and wrote some requirements that typically signal a stock is on an uptrend and is a good 'buy'. The superscreener script scans the S+P 500 for stocks that meet the specific criteria set and saves them into the data folder. I have also added user authentication to the application so when the project is finished users will have to login to see the picks the screener(s) gathered. 
#
#
## What Comes Next?
### Next I plan to add all the stock data retrieved from the TDA API into the SQLAlchemy database, so it can be displayed on the web app. I have much more to do on the front end as well, as many of the pages are not yet created. Once the front end and database are complete, and the app is deployable, I will start to incorporate some machine learning and statistical modeling for a more complex and accurate screener.
